#Contributing to GoSizzle.io

There are 3 levels of priority:

[HIGH](https://github.com/GiveToken/GiftBox/labels/High%20Priority) - work on
these before anything else

[MEDIUM](https://github.com/GiveToken/GiftBox/labels/Medium%20Priority) - these
are less important

[LOW](https://github.com/GiveToken/GiftBox/labels/Low%20Priority) - these may not
get done due to blocking issues or changes in business plans

We do weekly development releases on Friday with the intent to QA them by Monday
for a production release then.  We are using
[waffle.io](https://waffle.io/GiveToken/GiftBox) for
our Kanban board. The date tags, e.g. `20160815`, correspond to the
Monday production release which the resolution of the issue is intended to be
included in and are used to for swimlanes in waffle.io.
