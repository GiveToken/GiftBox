We use the [Mailchimp CSS Inliner Tool](http://templates.mailchimp.com/resources/inline-css/)
to create emails with inline css so they will work with HTML in mail programs.

Please modify the .html file and then get the code for the .inline.html file
from the inliner tool.

In all tracking links,

t = email_template.id
e = email address of the person who received the email

In some tracking links,

l = recruiting token long id
