			<br />
			<p align="left">
			    Giftly, Inc., a Delaware corporation (referred to in these Terms of Use as “Giftly,” “we,” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy
			    Policy governs the use and sharing of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) and other information about users (“users” or “you”)
			    that users voluntarily provide or make available to Giftly when they use Giftly’s web site and services delivered through the domain
			    https://www.givetoken.com (the “Site”). By using and submitting your information through this Site you consent to this Privacy Policy and to Giftly’s
			    collection and sharing of your Personal Information according to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p align="left">
			    Giftly may change this Privacy Policy from time to time in our sole discretion. We will provide notice by, at a minimum, updating this posting. You should
			    periodically review this Privacy Policy carefully. By using this Site, you acknowledge and agree to Giftly’s collection and sharing of your Personal
			    Information according to the terms of the then current Privacy Policy.
			</p>
			<br /><br />
			<p align="left">
			    <strong>Collecting Information About You</strong>
			</p>
			<br />
			<p align="left">
			    We collect information you share through the Site. We may collect Personal Information, such as email address, Facebook email, or other identifiers that
			    you provide to us. If you do not want information you submit to be used for direct marketing purposes, you may indicate so when submitting a form on the
			    Site. If a user remains anonymous while browsing the Site, or if the Site does not request any Personal Information from a user, we may collect the user’s
			    Internet protocol addresses (the Internet address of a computer) to track the user’s session.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p align="left">
			    Our web server may collect and store the following general information about you: the domain from which you access the Internet; the date and time you
			    access the Site; the pages you visit; the Internet address of the web site that linked you directly to us; and the type of device and web browser you use
			    to access the Site. This information is collected automatically. It is used to help us improve our web sites by tabulating the number of visitors to our
			    web sites in terms of new users, origin of referrers, popularity of pages, amount of use, and types of errors, and to make the web sites more useful to
			    you.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p align="left">
			    We may use “cookies,” which are small files stored on your computer’s hard drive that are used to store and track personal information. Many browsers can
			    notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the option to accept it or not. By not accepting cookies, you may not be permitted to access certain
			    information and some Site pages may not display properly.

			    mail, text, or phone for market research purposes.
