			    Collecting Information About You
			</h2>
			<p>
			    We collect information you share through the Site. We may collect Personal Information, such as email address, Facebook email, or other identifiers that
			    you provide to us. If you do not want information you submit to be used for direct marketing purposes, you may indicate so when submitting a form on the
			    Site. If a user remains anonymous while browsing the Site, or if the Site does not request any Personal Information from a user, we may collect the user’s
			    Internet protocol addresses (the Internet address of a computer) to track the user’s session.

			<p>
			    Our web server may collect and store the following general information about you: the domain from which you access the Internet; the date and time you
			    access the Site; the pages you visit; the Internet address of the web site that linked you directly to us; and the type of device and web browser you use
			    to access the Site. This information is collected automatically. It is used to help us improve our web sites by tabulating the number of visitors to our
			    web sites in terms of new users, origin of referrers, popularity of pages, amount of use, and types of errors, and to make the web sites more useful to
			    you.

				Via Google's 'Opt-Out Method' you will not facilitate the merging of personally-identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information previously collected from Display Advertising features that is based on the DoubleClick
				cookie unless you have robust notice of, and the user's prior affirmative (i.e., opt-in) consent to, that merger.
