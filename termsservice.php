			<p>
			    All User Contributions must comply with the Content Standards set out in these Terms of Service. By providing any User Contribution on the Platform, you

			    We have the right to:
			</p>
			<p>
			    · Remove or refuse to post any User Contributions for any or no reason in our sole discretion.
			</p>
			<p>
			    · Take any action with respect to any User Contribution that we deem necessary or appropriate in our sole discretion, including if we believe that such
			    User Contribution violates the Terms of Service, including the Content Standards, infringes any intellectual property right or other right of any person or

			</p>

			    intellectual property rights or their right to privacy.
